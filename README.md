# Template Application README

This is a template application that combines React with Vite on the client-side and Express with TRPC on the server-side. It is built using TypeScript and utilizes `cd client` and `cd server` to navigate to the client and server directories respectively. To run the application, use `pnpm run dev` in each directory to start the development servers for the client and server.
